# MFP-Bot
A simple discord bot to keep you from getting bored while you study/code, written in Rust.

The bot uses MusicForProgramming.net as it's music database.

I don't own any of the music that gets played or am affiliated with the website in anyway.

Contributions are welcome!

The "Serenity" and "Songbird" crates were a big help. Check them out if you're interested in making something like this for yourself! ;)
